# This is a horizontally scrolling website

I saw this innovative idea online of an Horizontal website, I was amazed by this innovative idea,  so i challenged my self to create this and was somewhat successful, this might not be the best website but it was fun making it

I didn't made the website responsive as i planned it to be a desktop specific website

I built a fake stationary store website (but horizontally), it was totally fun check it out...  

Thank You
